For several decades, Male fertility rates have been declining. As Male infertility accounts for 40% of all infertility cases , this downward trend is quite worrying. Low fertility rates are usually associated with diminished economic growth particularly due to a decline in workers per capita. This decrease in labor supply would especially be felt in countries where the elderly are already retired and receive social security from the government.

The factors that determine fertility rates are varied, ranging from culture, cost of raising children, and urbanization. These factors all require long term solutions which will be quite costly. One factor that can be tackled straightforward though is medical infertility, as factors such as those previously mentioned affect a persons choice and not their ability to have children.

People who are infertile for medical reasons can be given treatment to help them become fertile. This task would be much easier for governments to do as compared to changing a country's culture or providing education subsidies. However, to be able to treat infertility we must be able to diagnose it.

Conducting a mass fertility test on an entire population can be quite costly, both in the collection phase as well as the testing phase. However, If we are able to gather information that has a high correlation with fertility then it would simply be a matter of databasing patient records and running algorithms to identify potential infertile subjects. The factors we look at in this notebook are environment, medical history, and lifestyle. These factors have been studied with artificial intelligence and have shown promising results.

The problem would then be to see if there are any variables that are strongly correlated with infertility and if a Machine Learning algorithm would be able to accurately predict if a person is fertile or infertile.
