One of the famous Las Vegas taglines says: “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas”. However, with the advent of the digital revolution, the thought might not be the case anymore. What happens in Vegas not only stays in Vegas, but it also stays in the reviews of the people on different websites. Las Vegas is primarily known for the casinos and entertainment hubs. But what other industries do the city has to offer? Thus it brings the two problem statements for this project:

What industries and group of people can be clustered from the reviews in Las Vegas, Nevada?
What are the themes of the customer reviews that can be extracted from across the various industry in Las Vegas, Nevada?
To answer the problems above, the following methodology: Data Gathering, Vectorizing, Clustering, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Insights Generation were followed.

The project utilized the information from the provided scrapped Yelp Website directory: Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 12 with the Las Vegas Nevada’s JSON files containing the business listings and reviews. By vectorizing using Term-Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Techniques, the team were able to cluster the data via k-means and derived information from the dataset.

Five industries were derived based on the cluster formed from the dataset. It includes shopping, food and beverage, services, health and beauty, and medical industries. For each industry, different clusters and themes were also developed to describe unique personas based on customer experiences. The upvote attributes in terms of "useful", "funny", and "cool" represents the shared sentiments among different customer groups. The value knowing these information can benefit market strategists enabling them to further optimize their approach to their target market, particularly in Las Vegas, Nevada.
