<h1> Data Science Portfolio</h1>
<p> Here are some of the projects I have created as I am studying Data Science at the Asian Institute of Management. </p>

Check out my blog posts at Medium!

img {
  border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Gray border */
  border-radius: 4px;  /* Rounded border */
  padding: 5px; /* Some padding */
  width: 150px; /* Set a small width */
}

/* Add a hover effect (blue shadow) */
img:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 2px 1px rgba(0, 140, 186, 0.5);
