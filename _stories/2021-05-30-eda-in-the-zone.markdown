As the world economy has continued growing due to international trade and globalization, countries have been finding ways to get a slice of the growing economic ‘pie.’ Developing countries, in particular, have been eager to utilize the increasing wealth to uplift themselves from poverty and low production. One of the tools used by countries has been Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

These economic zones are selected geographical areas regulated by a set of laws which usually differ from the rest of the country. Business regulations in these zones are generally laxer (i.e., less bureaucratic obstacles and lower tariffs). Governments use SEZs to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI), which consequently provide jobs, and other complementing business opportunities for locals. [1]

However, like any economic strategy, an SEZ may also fail in its purpose mainly due to poor planning and overselling. Despite this, the benefits of FDIs and the proliferation of local industries still prove the economic zone strategy to be worth the risk. [2][3] Factors which affect the success of SEZs — such as demography, skills supply and demand, available infrastructure, and the distribution of zones — must be carefully studied.

The Republic Act No. 7916, known as the “Special Economic Zone Act of 1995,” provided a legal framework for the setting up of SEZs. The Republic Act created the Philippine Economic Zone Authority Board, referred to as PEZA, as the governing body for the zones. [4] As of 2017, the Philippines has 379 Operating Economic Zones, with most of them being Information Technology Parks/Centers.[5] With the growing number of SEZs, it is necessary to investigate their impact.

Our investigation focused on determining which regions would benefit from the addition of special economic zones. To do this, our group looked into the different job profiles for each region using the Philippine Census data of 2015* and related it to the distribution of SEZs.

Our group found that the bulk of economic zones are concentrated only in NCR along with high supply and demand for skilled labor. The disproportionately large number of SEZs (particularly IT SEZs) distributed among only a few regions may be roughly construed as “putting all eggs in one basket” — a scenario that can be economically catastrophic during times of pandemics or other localized disasters. We also found that an oversupply of high skilled labor in Regions I, II, VI, and CAR may indicate a readiness for the addition of economic zones according to respective job profiles.

In ensuring well-distributed economic growth, decisions on the establishment of SEZs must carefully consider the supply of skilled labor and the job profiles of each region. High supply of skilled labor matched with job opportunities, whether brought by economic zones or domestic reforms, often leads to rapid economic growth.
