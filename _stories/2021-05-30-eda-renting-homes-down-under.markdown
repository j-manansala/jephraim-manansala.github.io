“Live like a local” is one of Airbnb’s largest campaign catchphrases. It invites tourists to visit and stay in their dream destinations for a while.

In Sydney, Australia, the unaffordability of housing is a difficult challenge for the locals to get by on their lives. Moreover, this was further amplified with the entry of Airbnb as a disruptive innovation in the housing market, hotels, and conventional long term housing rents.

Using a data-driven approach, we have clustered Airbnb listings to identify which segment can the Sydney government act on to mitigate the unaffordability of housing.
