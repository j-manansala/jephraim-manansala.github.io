Earth Hour is a worldwide movement organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights, for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet. Now, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories to raise awareness for energy consumption and effects on the environment.

On this paper, we will be looking at the impact of the Earth hour in the Philippine Power Consumption and determine if it has the impact to make a difference. To do this, the load curve of the Philippine power consumption dataset will be explored. A load curve is a graphical representation of load (in MW) in proper time sequence and the time in hours. It shows the variation of load on the power station. Typically, the load curve of the power system is not same throughout the day. It differs from day to day and season to season. The load curve is mainly classified into two types, i.e., the summer load curve and the winter load curve.
