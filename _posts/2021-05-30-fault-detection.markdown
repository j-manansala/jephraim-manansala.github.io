Detecting partial discharge phenomenon in overhead power lines could help optimize the maintenance program of the utility companies - thereby reducing maintenance costs and reducing unnnecessary power outages. Today, experts are currently using Fast Fourier Transform to determine the fundamendal sinusoidal waveforms of the signal to determine if there is a partial discharge on a specific line. However, this requires trained experts and could take some time to identify and pinpoint. To fast-track the identification of overhead power line sections with partial discharge, it is proposed to utilize neural networks to detect this phenomenon. The results have shown that implementing capsule neural networks can yield a better accuracy when compared to a convolutional neural network. This can be attributed to the fact that the capsule neural network directly addresses the CNN's fatal flaw (max pooling) by utilizing dynamic routing of capsules.
