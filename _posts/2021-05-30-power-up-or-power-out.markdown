Electricity has been the backbone of the modern society and has been serving millions of people for several decades. However, behind the ease and comfort that electricity provides to our society is the complexity and intricacies that goes behind the eyes of the people. One of the several factors that needs to be considered is the Power System Stability of the electrical network. Predicting the power system stability of an electrical network is of upmost importance since electricity has been the backbone of modern society and a blackout can cause negative implications among businesses and institutions. With this in mind, machine learning classification models were developed to address this problem and the results have been promising.

The classification metric used was the recall score because of the importance of detecting all of the actual relevant items in this specific problem. Out of the nine machine learning models implemented, it was the Non-linear Support Vector Machine model that yielded the highest recall of 97%. However, it should be highlighted that even though the models were focused on the recall score, the Non-linear Support Vector Machine achieved a high score for both the precision and recall score. This only shows the value of applying domain knowledge on how machine learning models are implemented. Since it was known that the relationship of the system operating parameters (p, tau and g) are polynomial in nature, a polynomial kernel was used on the Non-linear Support Vector Machine. The model yielded a 97% precision and recall score. The high score on both the classification metric of precision and recall score shows the appropriateness of this machine learning model to the problem at hand.
